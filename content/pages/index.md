# Who am I?

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Natiq, a Software Developer student based in SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and currently working for [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.com).

My goal in life is to always love what I'm doing. This includes my work and my past times - I want to love it all. I am currently completing my Apprenticeship as a computer scientist-EFZ. I am discovering living and learning as a young adult and where I want my professional career to take me.

My career interests lie in Web-Development / Designing, Software Engineer, and Networking. Highly motivated Front and Back-End-Developer with amazing Designs. I started to learn programming on my own.

When I'm not programming, I'm probably hanging out with my friends and family, doing Sports, or learning new things.
