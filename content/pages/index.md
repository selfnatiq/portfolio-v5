# Who am I?

👋 I'm **Natiq**, a Software Developer student based in Switzerland🇨🇭 and currently working for [Swisscom](https://www.swisscom.com).

😊 I enjoy designing highly interactive user interfaces that enthuse customers and creating scalable, reliable backend solutions, also caring about other parts that are needed for a successful project.

👨🏼‍💻 I have maintained, developed and launched multiple projects from scratch, carrying the development of it's backend and frontend codebases. My current toolset includes TypeScript/JavaScript, **React**, Node.js and all the other various frameworks, libraries and technologies related to them.

When I'm not programming, I'm probably hanging out with my friends and family 🏡, doing Sports ⚽️, or learning 📝 new things.
