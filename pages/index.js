					My goal in life is to always love what I&apos;m doing. This includes my work and
					my past times - I want to love it all. I am currently completing my
					Apprenticeship as a computer scientist-EFZ. I am discovering living and learning
					as a young adult and where I want my professional career to take me.
				</p>

				<p>
					My career interests lie in Web-Development / Designing, Software Engineer, and
					Networking. Highly motivated Front and Back-End-Developer with amazing Designs.
					I started to learn programming on my own.
